# AWTRIX Music Visualizer

Real-time music visualizer for the **Ulanzi TC001** smart clock running AWTRIX 3.

Forked from https://github.com/jonsts/awtrix-music-visualizer

Your PC captures the audio, runs an FFT, maps it to frequency bands, and streams
frames to the clock's 32x8 RGB matrix over HTTP or MQTT.

```
PC (capture audio -> FFT -> bands -> color) --HTTP/MQTT--> TC001 (renders frame)
```

## How it works

The clock has no audio input exposed through its API, so all the signal
processing happens on the host. Each tick, the app:

1. Captures a block of audio (system loopback on Windows, or a mic/line-in).
2. Computes an FFT and groups bins into log-spaced bands.
3. Applies log compression, normalization, gain, and an envelope follower
   (instant attack, smooth release).
4. Renders the bands into an AWTRIX custom-app payload and sends it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+ (uses the stdlib `tomllib`)
- A TC001 on the same network running AWTRIX 3
- Dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - System-audio capture uses [`soundcard`](https://github.com/bastibe/SoundCard)
    for WASAPI loopback (python-sounddevice has no high-level loopback API).

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create your config from the example and edit it:

   ```
   copy config.example.toml config.toml    # Windows
   cp config.example.toml config.toml      # macOS/Linux
   ```

   - Set `device.ip` to your clock's IP address.
   - Choose `device.transport` = `"http"` or `"mqtt"` (HTTP is simplest).
   - If using MQTT, fill in the `[mqtt]` section (host, port, prefix, creds).

   `config.toml` is gitignored so your IP and credentials stay local. If it's
   missing, the app falls back to `config.example.toml`.

3. (Windows) Find your audio device for system-audio capture:

   ```
   python -m visualizer --list-devices
   ```

   This lists speakers and microphones. For system-audio capture keep
   `audio.loopback = true` and set `audio.device` to a substring of one of the
   **speaker** names (e.g. `Speakers (Realtek`). To capture a real mic instead,
   set `loopback = false` and match a microphone name. `device = "auto"` follows
   the Windows default output device automatically.

## Run

```
python -m visualizer
```

Stop with `Ctrl+C`; the display is cleared on exit. A web control panel starts
at <http://localhost:8888> (disable with `--no-web`, change port with `--port`).

To keep the visualizer pinned on screen instead of cycling through apps, disable
auto-transition on the clock (Settings: `ATRANS = false`).

## Visualization modes

Set `render.mode` in config, switch live in the web UI, or cycle with the clock's
right button.

| Mode | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `draw` | Vertical spectrum bars with peak-hold dots |
| `horizontal` | Bars growing outward from the center, one row per band |
| `ltr` | Horizontal bars growing left to right, one row per band |
| `waves` | Joy Division / *Unknown Pleasures* scrolling waveform landscape |
| `mario` | Super Mario overworld — green pipes, sky, ground, clouds |
| `mario_underground` | Mario underground — teal blocks on black, gold question block |
| `dancer` | A stick figure that dances and walks across the screen on the beat |
| `fractal` | Audio-reactive plasma or Julia set (`fractal_type`) |
| `bar` | AWTRIX's built-in bar graph (simple, max 16 bands) |

## Color schemes

`spectrum` (rainbow), `outrun` (synthwave), `fire`, `ocean`, `forest`, `ice`,
`neon`, `sunset`, `matrix`, and `solid` (custom color). Enable `color_cycle` to
smoothly rotate the palette over time.

## Physical buttons

The clock's three buttons control the visualizer over MQTT (requires MQTT
configured and the clock connected to the same broker):

| Button | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Left** | Cycle color scheme |
| **Middle** | Toggle the visualizer on/off |
| **Right** | Cycle render mode |

To stop the buttons from also navigating the clock's built-in apps, set
`BLOCKN = true` in the AWTRIX settings (the buttons still publish to MQTT).

## Web control panel

Open <http://localhost:8888> while running. Adjust gain, smoothing, fps, mode,
color scheme, frequency range, overlay text, idle behavior, and the enable
toggle — all live, no restart. Changes are saved back to `config.toml`.

## Auto-start on login (Windows)

```
python install_autostart.py            # register a Task Scheduler task
python install_autostart.py --remove   # remove it
```

## Notes & limits

- **Frame rate** is the main bottleneck: frames go over WiFi to an ESP32. HTTP
  realistically does ~15-20 fps. Start at `fps = 20`.
- The matrix is **32x8** — keep draw command counts reasonable; heavy payloads
  can stress the device's RAM and cause stutter or reboots.
- Frames are never saved to flash (no `save: true`), to protect the ESP's limited
  write cycles.
